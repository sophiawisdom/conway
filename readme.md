This is not very much cleaned up for public consumption, but contains Swift (in `/conway`) and C (in `/conway.c`) programs that attempt to find interesting randomly generated Conway's Game of Life patterns by random generation as well as an evolutionary mechanism (breeding patterns together). I am also working on a CUDA implementation.
